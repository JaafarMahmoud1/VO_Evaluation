## Evaluation Method
Based of ChArUco board, we can caluate the relative pose of the camera relative to the static board. This calculation is accurate enough to measure the drift and error in visual odometry algorithms.

ChArUco board are seen at the start and the end of testing videos, i.e. we will be able to calculate the error only when the ChArUco board is seen.

## Evaluation metrics
 - **Fail / Sucess**: to measure the robustness of the odometry.
 - **MAX_ERROR**: Maximim error along the trajectory.
 - **MEAN_ERROR**: MEAN Error along the trajectory.
 - **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error of the trajectory.

## Visual odometry /SLAM systems
- **ORB-SLAM3 odom** (Stereo, Loop closing is **OFF**)
- **Visual Odometry**: (Our visual odometry based on AIR-VO, with SP and SG)

## Notes on the results

- Although, ORB-SLAM3 fails tracking in most cases, although ORB-SLAM3 has a lot of features that can be inherited into AIR-VO as loop closing, and old points regonition.
- ORB-SLAM3 is scalable to other sensors and configurations. Their code is pretty clean, but would be hard to change core components of it, as the feature extractor.
- On the other hand, AIR-VO is only an odometry but performs robustly on these sequences, and in presense of challenges in visual odometry.
- We refactored the code of AIR-VO to support mono tracking, and even multi Camera setting (In progress) with fixed bugs.
